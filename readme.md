__In hingsight, this was a poor choice of chip, and this didn't work - see [mck1117/vr-interface](github.com/mck1117/vr-interface) for working design__


~~VR conditioner board for Honda OBD0, OBD1, and early OBD2 VR sensors~~

~~Based (heavily) on https://rusefi.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1115&p=20857&hilit=honda#p20862~~

~~Rerouted as 2-layer board and reduced PCB area by more than 50%.~~
